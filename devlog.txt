order of implementations

1. render a cube with shaders
2. sample image and render the terrain, add shadows with face normals, camera movement
3. added imgui for changing values on the fly
4. made the fps counter more accurate, made normals not move when moving camera,
   camera moves more intuitively, fps counter now does an average
5. can change terrain size with imgui sliders, divided cubes into faces such that i dont add bottom faces when stacking cubes. started on indices
6. indices now work, made each face use less vertices, but couldn't bring the number of vertices of a cube to 8 because of connecting faces having different normals
7. made the imgui stuff better
8. started dividing the code into files, to handle multiple shader programs, moved shaders into their own files.
9. finally understood how to work with multiple shader programs, now we have chunk generation and chunk wireframes
10. fixed the chunk generation to acknowledge neighbor chunks
